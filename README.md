## Statistical considerations for the e-WHORM trial design

Simulation study on the design of a randomized, placebo-controlled,
double-blind, parallel-group phase-II study to investigate the efficacy
and safety of oxfendazole (OXF) in subjects with onchocerciasis,
loiasis, mansonellosis and/or soil-transmitted helminth.
