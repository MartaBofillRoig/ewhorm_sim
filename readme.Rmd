## Statistical considerations for the e-WHORM trial design

Simulation study on the design of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group phase-II study to investigate the efficacy and safety of oxfendazole (OXF) in subjects with onchocerciasis, loiasis, and/or mansonellosis.

This repository contains the main code and R-functions to reproduce results of the simulation study in "An Adaptive Phase II Basket Trial Design for Dose Selection and Addition in Microfilarial Infections". It includes:

- R package `ewhorm` with functions to simulate and analyse adaptive basket trials as outlined in the manuscript.
- R scripts to perform simulations
