Statistical considerations for designing e-WHORM adaptive trial

## Statistical considerations for the e-WHORM trial design

Simulation study on the design of a randomized, placebo-controlled,
double-blind, parallel-group phase-II study to investigate the efficacy
and safety of oxfendazole (OXF) in subjects with onchocerciasis,
loiasis, mansonellosis and/or soil-transmitted helminth.

This repository includes:

- R package `ewhorm` with functions to simulate and analyse adaptive
  basket trials
- R scrips to perform simulations
